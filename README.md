# Agriculture_Field_Pattern_Classification using Deep Learning

Solving a multi-class classification problem of classifying aerial RGB farmland images based on patterns like standing water, weed cluster, cloud shadow, etc. using deep learning models like DCNN and pre-trained models like VGG-16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNet and DetNet using transfer learning techniques.

This project was developed and trained using Google Colaboratory. It uses tensorflow version 2.5.1

The src folder contains the source code. It contains 5 files:-

DCNN_and_VGG16.ipynb - Contains code and output for Deep CNN and VGG 16 Model trained.
EfficientNetB0.ipynb - Contains code and output for Efficient Net Model trained.
Resnet50final.ipynb - Contains code and output for ResNet50 Model trained.
detnet.ipynb - Contains code and output for DetNet Model trained.
InceptionV3.ipynb - Contains code and output for InceptionV3 Model trained.
The Sample Dataset conatins 4 folders namely, weed_cluster, waterway, standing_water and cloud_shadow corresponding to the field pattern images it contains. Each folder contains 12 images.
